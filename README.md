# Update

It has been a super big update since 2023!
I learned to use [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) to manage the HTML rendering and to make a easy-to-write enviroment for me. 

## Add publication

To add a new publication, add the following code in the `publications` of `content/works.publications.json` and edit the content accordingly:

```json
{
    "thumb": "",
    "title": "",
    "authors": "",
    "date": "",
    "source": "",
    "links": [
        ["", "", "paper"]
    ]
},
```

## Add project

Similar to publication, add the following in the `content/works.projects.json`:

```json
{
    "slug": "",
    "date": "",
    "thumb": "",
    "title": "",
    "organization": "",
    "location": "",
    "description": "",
    "links": [
        ["", "", "demo"]
    ]
}
```
