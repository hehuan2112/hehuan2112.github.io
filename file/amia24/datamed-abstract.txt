DataMed 2.0: A Discovery Index for Finding Biomedical Datasets

Presentation Time: 10:15 AM - 10:30 AM

Abstract Keywords: Data Mining, Data Sharing, Information Visualization
Primary Track: Applications

Recent growth in data science continues to accumulate data in various repositories within the biomedical domain. The tremendous growth of data challenges the researchers to find the relevant ones from all repositories. DataMed, a data discovery index, indexes the data from various repositories. In the current study, we developed a new web interface and included many advanced features such as a visualization interface. We release DataMed 2.0 for finding the biomedical datasets from NIH-endorsed repositories.
