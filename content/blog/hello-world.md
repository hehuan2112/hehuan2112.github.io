Slug: hello-world
Summary: Every project starts with a `hello world`

It's just a `Hello world`, and in fact it's more than a simple hello world.

Usually, "Hello, World!" is a simple and often the first program written by a computer science student. It is a program that outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the screen and is used to demonstrate the basic syntax and structure of a programming language.

The concept of "Hello, World!" was first introduced in the book "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in 1978. Since then, it has become a standard first program for many programming languages such as C, Java, Python, and more.

The purpose of "Hello, World!" is to provide a starting point for new programmers to understand how to write and run a program. It serves as a simple and easy-to-understand example of how to use basic programming concepts such as variables, data types, and functions.

The program itself is usually very short and simple. In the case of a basic "Hello, World!" program in C, the code might look like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

If you use Python, it would be simpler:

```Python
print('Hello, World!')
```

or JavaScript:

```JavaScript
console.log('Hello, World');
```

While "Hello, World!" may seem trivial, it is an important starting point for learning how to program. By writing this simple program, new programmers can get a feel for how a program is structured, how to use basic programming concepts, and how to compile and run a program.

In conclusion, "Hello, World!" is a simple and classic program that is still used today to teach the basics of programming. Whether you are a seasoned programmer or just starting out, writing this program can be a great way to learn the fundamentals of programming and get a feel for how a program works. And I believe this tiny "Hello, World!" is the start of a big program in future.

*In fact, this "Hello, World" page helps copying all files and images to the output path for this whole webiste! :)*
