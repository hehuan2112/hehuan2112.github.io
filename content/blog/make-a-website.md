Summary: It takes time to make a website, but sometimes you may not realize it takes a very long time.

I work on building a tiny website recently.
But I'm not a full-time developer, at least my job title is not.
So how can I build it quickly and go back to my own work?

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>New Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- something fancy here -->
</body>
</html>
```

I know at last, a website is a HTML file like the above code or many files.
But I will feel tired if I need to create all those files from scratch.
So, there are many tools and platforms can help, and some of them are pretty good and FREE!
